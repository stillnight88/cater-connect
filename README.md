# CaterConnect

CaterConnect is a full-stack web application for managing catering services and customer interactions.

This repository is currently transitioning from a React-based frontend to a Next.js application.  
The existing React implementation is preserved while the Next.js foundation is being introduced.

---

## Project Status

**Status:** Active migration to Next.js

- The current `main` branch contains the React implementation and will be moved to a separate branch when Next.js development begins.
- A new Next.js-based setup is being prepared to become the primary codebase.
- Feature development will continue incrementally during the migration.

The project is not deployed to production at this stage.

---

## Project Direction

This repository is being migrated to Next.js to improve:

- Application structure and routing
- Long-term maintainability
- Scalability for future features
- Frontend and backend integration

The migration is tracked through commits and pull requests rather than static phase documentation.
