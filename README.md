# CaterConnect

CaterConnect is a web application for managing catering services and customer interactions.

This repository is currently being restructured to use Next.js for the frontend (App Router).

## Project Status

- Active development (not deployed)
- The `main` branch is being prepared as the **Next.js-based codebase**
- The earlier React implementation will be preserved in a separate branch for reference

## Direction

The move to Next.js is intended to improve:

- Application structure and routing

- Long-term scalability

Changes are tracked through commits and pull requests.
